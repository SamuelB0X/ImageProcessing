# Image Processing

Application that is capable of modifying images by cropping the edges, making a negative version, stretching it horizontally, reducing it vertically,
inverting the image, applying a color filter, painting an image with random colors, drawing a rectangle and making abstract art using two-dimensional (2D) arrangements.
